# langgraph-rag-agent-example

ðŸš€ This repository contains hands-on examples from [LangGraph Complete Course for Beginners â€“ Complex AI Agents with Python by Vaibhav Mehra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGg_1h0qzaM).

ðŸ¦™ **LLAMA Models Used:**  
Instead of OpenAI, this repo uses `llama3.2:latest` and `nomic-embed-text` models via Ollama.  
Make sure your Ollama server is running and both models are downloaded before running the code:

```sh
ollama pull llama3.2:latest
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```
